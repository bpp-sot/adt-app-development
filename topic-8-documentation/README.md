# Practical 1 Handout: Writing a Living README

## Module: App Development (Level 6)
**Topic 8: Documentation**  
**Practical Focus:** Creating professional project documentation using Markdown.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this practical, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose of a README file in a software project.
- Create clear and structured documentation for your application.
- Use Markdown to format technical documentation.
- Commit documentation updates to GitHub.
- Understand how documentation supports your final portfolio assessment.

## What Is a README?

A README is the **front door** of your project. It tells:

- What your app does  
- Why it exists  
- How to run it  
- What it depends on  
- What still needs improving  

Good documentation improves:
- Maintainability
- Collaboration
- Professional credibility
- Portfolio quality

---

## Practical Task Overview

You will update or create a **README.md** file inside your **GitHub repository**.

Your README must include the core professional sections listed below.

This task contributes directly to your portfolio documentation evidence.

---

## Required README Sections

Your README **must include** the following sections:

### 1. Project Overview

Explain:
- What your application does
- Who it is for (target audience)
- The main problem it solves

Example:
> This application helps users track their daily habits using a mobile-friendly web interface.

---

### 2. Setup & Deployment Instructions

Explain:
- How to clone the project
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the app locally

Example:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 3. Dependencies & SDKs

List:
- Main frameworks (React, Vite, etc.)
- AWS Amplify services
- APIs or third-party SDKs

You may use a bullet list or table.

---

### 4. Known Issues & Future Improvements

Document:
- Any bugs
- Missing features
- Planned enhancements

This shows **professional reflection**, not weakness.

---

## Markdown Formatting Requirements

You must demonstrate use of:

- Headings (`# ## ###`)
- Code blocks (```)
- Links
- Bullet lists or tables

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open your **GitHub repository** in the browser.
2. Locate **README.md**
3. Click the **edit (✏️) button**
4. Add all required sections.
5. Preview your formatting.
6. Commit your changes with a message such as:
   > "Updated README with project documentation"

---

## Assessment Link

Your README acts as evidence for:

- Process documentation
- Professional software practice
- Portfolio communication quality
- Technical writing skills

Well-maintained documentation directly supports your **final grade**.

---

## Checklist Before You Commit

- [ ] Project overview written
- [ ] Setup instructions included
- [ ] Dependencies listed
- [ ] Known issues or future plans added
- [ ] Markdown formatting used
- [ ] Changes committed to GitHub

---

## Reflection Activity

Answer in your own words:

> How will keeping your documentation updated improve your portfolio and employability?

---

## Stretch Challenge (Optional)

- Add a **screenshots** section
- Add a **features list**
- Add a **license** section
- Add a **contribution guide**

---

## Key Message

> If you change the app - update the docs.

Professional developers document continuously, not at the end.
